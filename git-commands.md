# Git Commands 

## Basic Commands
- `git init`: Initialize a new repository
- `git add <file>`: Add files to the staging area
- `git commit -m "comment"`: Commit changes to the repository
    - make the comment a meaningful one to help understand what changes are made
- `git status`: Show the status of the working directory
    - run it before commit commands to see which files are being committed
- `git log`: Log what has been done
    - if you see (END), press Q to quit 
- `rm <file>`: Remove file
- `touch <file>`: Modify an existing file or create it if it doesn't already exist

## Github
## Collaboration
- `git pull`: Pull the latest changes from the remote repository
- `git push --set-upstream origin <current branch>`: Push local changes to the remote repository (?)
- `git clone <ssh code from github>`: Create a local copy of the repository 
- `git switch main`: Switch to branch 'main'
- `git switch -c <branch name>`: Create a new branch
- `git branch`: Tell which branch you are on (This is something I found out making these notes)
